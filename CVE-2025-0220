It is possible to induce the application to open a pop-up containing session information through the injection of a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) payload.
When accessing the application while authenticated, the "Ethernet Configuration" menu was accessed, and in the "Hostname" field, the payload "</script><script>alert(1)</script> was inserted. After interacting with the "Change Configuration" button, the pop-up generated by the payload was observed.
